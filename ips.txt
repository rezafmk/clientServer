# With this version, we can have 3 clients (or even more), 2 of which f-stack and one linux client. And a single server on another machine.
# Note this is using the IP bifurcation (so f-stack should be configured that way), and thus, there is no need for the client to bind to its ip:port anymore.
# Note also that there are a few hardcoded paths in client/server files that need to be changed if we move this.
# Seems like the IP addresses of f-stack clients/server don't need to be setup previoulsy (with f-stack-ifconfig or ARP), but this is not proven so noting it here (obviously this is not true for the linux client/server ones)
clients on 10.250.136.19 (which is vp22)
server on 10.250.136.21 (which is vp23)
